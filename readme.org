* pyqtilt

+ A fully fledged battery included modules/classes/members/functions inspector
+ Arguments and members are editable.
+ Functions can be called by double clicking them or by pressing enter.
+ Activating the __init__ method of a class does bring a new instance into the tree
+ since tuple are immutables, editing one does copy then overwrites the previous one
+ The inspection will detect methods with invalid signatures,
  so far, only initializer lacking a self parameter (written with the underscore sign in my book)
+ displayed value in the tree can be refreshed in realtime

Todo :
- trace changes

* Requirements
PyQt5
